/* (CPP)
   IO Manager:
     - Manages PropertyList Input and Output streams
     - Has iterable array of property lists, enabling
       browsability of properties
     - Contains its own property list for timers and other IO settings
     - Has Timer based PropertyList Outputs
     - May even have some sort of error/warning Output ability (lets hope)

    - Has Methods:
      - High-Level:
        - AppendList:
           appends PropetyList to PropertyList array (unless array full)
        - GetList: 
           gets entire list if no args, 
	    or gets specified index, 
	    **or maybe gets all specified by array**
	- GetAll: 
	   gets all lists in PropertyList array
	- SetItem
	   sets values for given item based on protocol ... need this


-----> need some sorts of check/set flags <<< probably low level <<<

      - Low-Level: <- this will probably be packaged in a single function
          Transmit:
	    - sends out a set number of chars per cycle
          Receive:
	    - recieves a single byte every cycle
