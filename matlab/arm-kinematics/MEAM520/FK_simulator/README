Run the "demo.m" file to check out the functionalities of the simulator. You can base your code on the demo file.

puma260.m is a script which has to be run first before using any of the other functions.

Your code can call the functions pumaLED,pumaServo,pumaAngles & pumaMove with proper inputs. 

Type help <function_name> in the MATLAB prompt to get a summary of what each function does. 

The FK_simulator directory has to be in the MATLAB search path for this to work.

You can add a folder and its subfolders to the MATLAB path by saying:		

addpath(genpath('c:/matlab/myfiles')) 

where "myfiles" is the directory that you want to add and 'c:/matlab/myfiles' is its path. In LINUX, you need administrator access to do this.
 
More info on the functions may be posted on the MEDESIGN website later.
